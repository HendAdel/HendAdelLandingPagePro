        <p>JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages
          — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at —
          displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc.
          — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved. It is the third layer of the layer cake of standard web
          technologies, two of which (HTML and CSS).</p>
        <p>HTML is the markup language that we use to structure and give meaning to our web content, for example
          defining paragraphs, headings, and data tables, or embedding images and videos in the page.
          CSS is a language of style rules that we use to apply styling to our HTML content, for example setting
          background colors and fonts, and laying out our content in multiple columns.
          JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control
          multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else. (Okay, not everything, but it is amazing what you
          can achieve with a few lines of JavaScript code.)</p>

        <h2>JS History</h2>
        <p>JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich in 1995.

          It was developed for Netscape 2, and became the ECMA-262 standard in 1997.

          After Netscape handed JavaScript over to ECMA, the Mozilla foundation continued to develop JavaScript for the
          Firefox browser. Mozilla's latest version was 1.8.5. (Identical to ES5).

          Internet Explorer (IE4) was the first browser to support ECMA-262 Edition 1 (ES1).
          In 1996, Netscape and Brendan Eich took JavaScript to the ECMA international standards organization, and a
          technical committee (TC39) was created to develop the language.

          ECMA-262 Edition 1 was released in June 1997.</p>
        <p>From ES4 to ES6
          When the TC39 committee got together in Oslo in 2008, to agree on ECMAScript 4, they were divided into 2 very
          different camps:

          The ECMAScript 3.1 Camp:
          Microsoft and Yahoo who wanted an incremental upgrade from ES3.

          The ECMAScript 4 Camp:
          Adobe, Mozilla, Opera, and Google who wanted a massive ES4 upgrade.

          August 13 2008, Brendan Eich wrote an email:

          It's no secret that the JavaScript standards body, Ecma's Technical Committee 39, has been split for over a
          year, with some members favoring ES4, a major fourth edition to ECMA-262, and others advocating ES3.1 based on
          the existing ECMA-262 Edition 3 (ES3) specification. Now, I'm happy to report, the split is over.

          The solution was to work together:

          ECMAScript 4 was renamed to ES5
          ES5 should be an incremental upgrade of ECMAScript 3.
          Features of ECMAScript 4 should be picked up in later versions.
          TC39 should develop a new major release, bigger in scope than ES5.
          The planned new release (ES6) was codenamed "Harmony" (Because of the split it created?).

          ES5 was a huge success. It was released in 2009, and all major browsers (including Internet Explorer) were
          fully compliant by July 2013</p>

        <h2>The DOM</h2>
        <p>When you request a website, no matter what backend language is powering that website, it will respond with
          HTML. The browser receives a stream of HTML. The bytes are run through a complicated (but fully documented)
          parsing process that determines the different characters (e.g. the start tag character <, an attribute like
            href, a closing angle bracket like>). After parsing has occurred, a process called tokenization begins.
            Tokenization takes one character at a time and builds up tokens. The tokens are:

            DOCTYPE
            start tag
            end tag
            comment
            character
            end-of-file
            Let's take a break for a second. At this state, the browser has received the bytes that've been sent by a
            server. The browser has converted the bytes to tags and has read through the tags to create a list of
            tokens.

            This list of tokens then goes through the tree construction stage. The output of this stage is a tree-like
            structure - this is the DOM!</p>
        <p>So the DOM is a model (representation) of the relationships and attributes of the HTML document that was
          received. Remember that DOM stands for "Document Object Model". Something that I've found to be true as I've
          been learning is that to break something down, just read the thing backwards:

          Document Object Model

          ...would become…

          Object Model of the Document!

          Remember that a JavaScript object is a tree-like structure that has properties and values. So the DOM can be
          accessed using a special object provided by the browser: document</p>
